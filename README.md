# Logistic-Regression

Logistic Regression is a supervised classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable. It can be used for various classification problems that can be either binomial or multinomial. 

Here, i have taken few datasets from the internet and tried to fit a logistic regression model on them.

First, the dataset used is Titanic that predicts which passenger the Titanic shipwreck, and was taken from Kaggle. The variable survived needs to be predicted and that is done using all other variables from the dataset. The survived column contains the values 0 and 1. The accuracy obtained is 79.85%.

Next dataset used is Pima Indians Diabetes which is available in the package mlbench. The variable diabetes needs to be predicted and all the other variables are used as the independent variables. Diabetes column has values "pos" and "neg". The accuracy obtained is 73.91%.The ROC curve and AUC was drawn, the AUC value obtained was 0.82.

Next dataset used is
